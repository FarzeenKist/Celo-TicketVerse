# Celo-TicketVerse
"The Ticket Verse" is a simple Web3 market place inspired by the celo development 101 challenge. The basic concept of the DAPP is to bring together event organizers to sell their event tickets in a decentralized manner, and also provide ticket holders a way to make money by allowing them to re-list or resell their tickets for a higher price on the market place
